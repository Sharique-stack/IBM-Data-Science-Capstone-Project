I will be using MCI data from Toronto police and analyze the crime rates in different neighborhood of Toronto. Then I will understand the rent/lease structure of areas less prone to hazard. Then I will forge Foursquare API to find out if there is other successful similar business(restaurant) in an area which has lower crime rate and more affordable lease amount. In simple words I will analyze all three genres of data to come up with most optimum view.
